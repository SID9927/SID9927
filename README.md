ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Siddharth!

I'm a recent PG-DAC graduate from CDAC Mumbai with a keen passion for software development. I bring a strong foundation in C++, Java, .NET, MySQL, and frontend technologies. My journey into tech took a significant turn after three years of preparing for government exams, where I developed essential skills in time management, problem-solving, and meticulous attention to detail.

ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™ve also completed a .NET Full Stack Development certification from Ducat IT School, Noida. Currently, I'm diving deep into web development with a focus on React, alongside my experience with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and JavaScript.

ðŸŒ± My dedication to learning drives me to create something new every day and continuously expand my knowledge. I'm eager to apply my diverse skill set and passion for coding in a challenging software development role.

ðŸ’¼ Looking for exciting opportunities to contribute to innovative projects and connect with like-minded professionals in the tech industry.

ðŸ“« Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.

âš¡ Fun fact: My interest in web development grew significantly after Eight months of intensive training, fueling my commitment to daily creation and learning.
